<!-- ![Pipeline status](https://github.com/db-ui/core/badges/main/pipeline.svg?style=flat) -->

DB Personenverkehr and DB Systel are merging their Design Systems for Web [with DB Design System](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/DB-UX-Design-System/Design-fuer-Apps-Web/UI-Komponenten) as their successor. Our goal is to provide a common UX based on the [DB "Moderne Ikone"](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Marke-und-Design#) for customer and employee applications. To achieve an end 2 end consistence from conception to implementation, we'll provide this new version of DB UI Core (npm: `@db-ui/core`), that is being used within a Design System by T.R (Reisendeninformation) as well. Stay Tuned!

You could still use the existing version of [DB UI Core that is based on version 1.6 of the guidelines (only hosted internally)](https://db.de/4cwtyn). For new projects we recommend to use this new version.

DB UI Core provides robust HTML UI components, reusable visual styles, and powerful tooling to help developers, designers, and content authors build, maintain, and scale best of class digital experiences.

## Core principals

### Consistent & Compliant

DB UI Core is based on the [DB UX Design System](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/DB-UX-Design-System/Design-fuer-Apps-Web/UI-Komponenten), that are the guidelines for any Personenverkehr Customer and Deutsche Bahn Enterprise website and web applications.

### Accessible

DB UI Core leverages semantic HTML, ARIA roles, states and properties to apply our styles wherever possible, thus enforcing correct, accessible markup. And we're quality checking this in partnership with the [Team Digital Accessibility](https://db.de/8pei5n).

### Declarative

DB UI Core uses declarative selectors instead of visual helpers to ensure our HTML class names and structure are human read- and understandable, lean, performant and so much easier to update.

### Decoupled

DB UI Core is decoupled from the JavaScript layer, to implement the patterns in any Web Development technology context; and we're providing universal Web Components and native JS framework components with [DB UI Elements](https://db-ui.github.io/elements/) as well.

### Evergreen

As [DB UX Design System](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/DB-UX-Design-System/Design-fuer-Apps-Web/UI-Komponenten) evolves, so does DB UI Core, meaning apps only need to keep their DB UI Core package updated to ensure the latest look and feel.

## More information

Additionally we'll provide some more information over time regrading the whole ecosystem:

## Things to keep in mind

### Developed for and driven by the community

This is mainly a platform providing the space and technology for a common basis of curated components; their development is mainly driven by the community and adapted out of the work done in projects and through the huge amount of feedback that we're gaining out of the community. So please support us in any way possible, this is greatly appreciated!

## How to use

Download DB UI Core to get the compiled CSS (and the small parts of JavaScript), source code, or include it with npm package manager (repository on _npmjs.com_ or _yarn_).

### _npmjs.com_ or _yarn_ (recommended)

In case you'd like to use DB UI Core as a dependency in your (frontend) build process and you even also care about handling DB UI Core as a dependency (e.g. for updates etc.), you need to install it as a dependency to your project and then link it within your HTML (CSS file) or within your SCSS.
Please have a look into the [Docs / Get Started](docs/getStarted.adoc) for detailed instructions.

### Download or CDN references

You could as well download all of the files that you would elsewhere retrieve via the node package directly or reference them from a CDN, as provided by the several different services listed e.g. at <https://yarnpkg.com/package/@db-ui/core>

## How to start develop / contribute

```Bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Give us your feedback!

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 -->

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

This is only the first version of our framework and we really want your feedback - either within the <a href="https://db.de/krnm74" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DB UI Channel by Web Dev Community in Microsoft Teams (only available DB internally)</a>, or directly at [db-ux-designsystem@deutschebahn.com](mailto:db-ux-designsystem@deutschebahn.com).
We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.

## FAQ

### Our `scss` / `sass` build doesn't work any more after migrating from version 1 of DB UI Core.

In case that you're retrieving any errors like the following, please check for whether you've [provided the location of your `node_modules` folders path to your sass compiler](docs/migrationGuide.adoc#user-content-db-ui-core-2-0-0-migration-guide):

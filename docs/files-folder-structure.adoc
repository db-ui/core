## Files and folder structure

link:https://patternlab.io/[pattern lab] system structure files and folders are formatted in italic. Most common aspects like `package.json` are being left out.

* `.husky`: Storing the Git lifecycle scripts / hooks like e.g. regarding [commit message linting](adr/linting-git.adoc) or pre-commit code formatting via link:adr/code_style_formatter-prettier.adoc[prettier] supported by link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky[husky]
* `.nojekyll`: Preventing the `jekyll` build by GitHub Pages, as we're building our files with our setup (mainly `pattern lab`, `scss` and `babel`)
* `.vscode`: Providing Microsoft Visual Studio Code IDE configurations, currently recommended extensions
* `docs`: including relevant documentation as well as ADRs
* `_helpers_`: storing handlebars helper scripts
* `_public_`: for the _patternlab_ system exports
* `scripts`: internally used scripts for maintenance tasks
* `_source_`: contains all of our individual pattern related files
** `__annotations_`: possible annotations to the patterns
** `__data_`: contains global data that could get retrieved within the pattern files
** `__meta_`: beginning and end (head and foot) code of the pattern files
** `__patterns_`: contains all of our pattern related files (HTML/hbs, CSS/SCSS, minimal JavaScript). The concept behind the structure is to have all of those technologies stored next to each other in an intuitive folder structure.
*** `00-base`: Including global styles and "design tokens"
*** `01-elements`: Simplest pattern type
*** `02-components`: Grouped elements into components
*** `03-areas`: Possibility to provide styles that should overwrite elements or components styles based on this context level
*** `04-pages`: We'd like to provide further (example) pages in the near future, like e.g. an imprint or login
*** `00-global.md`: Intro page for the patternlab system
** `_css_`: Skeleton SCSS files that are including the SCSS files within the __patterns_ subfolders

Import `_webpack.assets-paths.scss` for Webpack <5 or old `sass-loader`. With Webpack >= version 5 or newer `sass-loader`, please import file `_rollup.assets-paths.scss` instead.

## Files and folder structure

link:https://patternlab.io/[pattern lab] system structure files and folders are formatted in italic. Most common aspects like `package.json` are being left out.

* `.husky`: Storing the Git lifecycle scripts / hooks like e.g. regarding [commit message linting](adr/linting-git.adoc) or pre-commit code formatting via link:adr/code_style_formatter-prettier.adoc[prettier] supported by link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky[husky]
* `.nojekyll`: Preventing the `jekyll` build by GitHub Pages, as we're building our files with our setup (mainly `pattern lab`, `scss` and `babel`)

** `__annotations_`: possible annotations to the patterns
** `__data_`: contains global data that could get retrieved within the pattern files
** `__meta_`: beginning and end (head and foot) code of the pattern files
** `__patterns_`: contains all of our pattern related files (HTML/hbs, CSS/SCSS, minimal JavaScript). The concept behind the structure is to have all of those technologies stored next to each other in an intuitive folder structure.

# How to create and provide the technical icon files

We're getting these icons by the DB Design System colleagues and process the following changes:

- Minifications with `ImageOptim`
- Adding some contents within the SVGs (these assets might get exported correctly in the future)
  - CSS variables
  - `id`-Attribute
- Afterwards the JSON files within the `source/_patterns/icons` path might need to get updated

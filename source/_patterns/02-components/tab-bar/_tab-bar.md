## Multi-line

The multi-line tabs haven't been developed, but are only available in the Sketch library. If you really need this pattern even also in the development, please set it up yourself e.g. with a `<br>` or differentiated label texts e.g. by `<span>` elements.

## Accessibility

This pattern has been tested and approved regarding accessibility.

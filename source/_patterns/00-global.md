# Global

This is a dynamic styleguide. We are working on this continuously. It is influenced by project work. Please share your experience with us at <db-ux-designsystem@deutschebahn.com>.

The global category defines visual elements such as color, font families, and motion. While not technically UI components, these elements are critical to document in the pattern library.

We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.

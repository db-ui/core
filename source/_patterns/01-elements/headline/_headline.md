## Pulse

You could add the DB Pulse to the headline element by adding the `data-pulse` attribute â€“ we're taking care of sizing it accordingly to the DB logo if this one is also present on the same page, as defined by the rules on the [Marketingportal](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/de/brandguide/logo-3).

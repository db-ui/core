## Variations/configurability

### Size

#### SCSS (recommended)

Extend one of the size SCSS placeholders in case that you don't want the default (medium): `%size-Small` or `%size-Large`

#### HTML attribute

You could set the different button sizes via the `data-size` attribute, the default is "medium" and in that case is optional.

## Form validation

Please have a look especially at the section for form validation within the overall [components/forms](../components-form/index.html) page.

Additionally to the browser built-in pseudo-selector `:invalid` we're providing styling for the [`aria-invalid="true"` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-invalid_attribute) as well.

## Variations/configurability

### Size

#### SCSS (recommended)

Extend one of the size SCSS placeholders in case that you don't want the default (medium): `%size-Small` or `%size-Large`

#### HTML attribute

You could set the different button sizes via the `data-size` attribute, the default is "medium" and in that case is optional.

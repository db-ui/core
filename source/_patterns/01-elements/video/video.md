## Subtitles

Please keep in mind to provide subtitles to your video content via WebVTT files:

- <http://html5doctor.com/video-subtitling-and-webvtt/>
- <https://www.vtt-creator.com/>

These do not only help people with hearing disabilities, but other users as well that couldn't listen to the sound due to their environment, like e.g. travelling in public transport.

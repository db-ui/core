## Variations/configurability

### Variant

#### HTML attribute

You could set the different button variants via the `data-variant` attribute. These could be either one of the four feedback values, or the "point of interest" stylings.

### Size

#### SCSS (recommended)

Extend the size placeholder in case that you don't want the default (regular): `%size-Small`

#### HTML attribute

You could set the different button sizes via the `data-size` attribute, the default is "regular" and in that case is optional.

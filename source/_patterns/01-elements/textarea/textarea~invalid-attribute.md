## Form validation

Please have a look especially at the section for form validation within the overall [components/forms](../components-form/index.html) page.

Additionally to the browser built-in pseudo-selector `:invalid` we're providing styling for the [`aria-invalid="true"` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-invalid_attribute) as well.

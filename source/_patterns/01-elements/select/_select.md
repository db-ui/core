This element doesn't fulfill the styleguides definitions especially on the option elements styling, as this isn't possible x-browser without JavaScript.
If you would like to even also match those visual requirements, you would need to choose a progressive JavaScript solution on your own.

## Form validation

Please have a look especially at the section for form validation within the overall [components/forms](../components-form/index.html) page.

Additionally to the browser built-in pseudo-selector `:user-invalid` we're providing styling for the [`aria-invalid="true"` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-invalid_attribute) as well.

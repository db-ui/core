## Browser compatibility

This `input` type is [compatible with the relevant browsers](https://caniuse.com/input-datetime) - macOS Safari support is included [in the Safari Technology Preview versions](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119175#c20) and will most likely follow in the next minor or major release of that browser.

You could easily integrate the possibility to provide auto suggestions to your input fields via the [`list`-attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#list) on the `input`-HTML-elements as well as adding the suggestions via the [`datalist`-HTML-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist).

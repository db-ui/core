To set the maximum length of allowed characters on an input element, you could use the `maxlength`-attribute on the input field. This would additionally provide a visual counter.

Please keep in mind that you'll probably have to position the output element yourself in relation to the context of e.g. a wrapping HTML element; we'll have a future solution by CSS Anchor Positioning as well.

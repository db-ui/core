## Breakpoint for the header

If you'd like to control the breakpoint that we've set for the `header` parts, you could overwrite the `SCSS` variable `$db-narrower-screen-max-width` with a new value that should get used within the CSS code for that breakpoint, like e.g. `800px`.

## Fixed positioned header

You could set the header area to fixed positioning by adding the class `has-fixed-header` to the `body` HTML tag.
